description: This is a simple web app that randomly displays a reason why League of Legends players are still in Bronze league. It's a pretty important project to me as it was my first ever web app and a milestone to becoming a developer. Also you gotta admit some of the reasons are kind of funny. It was built using Ruby on Rails/Heroku.
