                    <p>I'm a Front End Developer from NYC with over 2 years of
                    experience building websites and web applications. I got my
                    interest in developing when I was doing web analytics and
                    email marketing as a Digital Marketer. When I had to build
                    my first website, I decided to dive deeper into web development
                    by joining <a class="text-link" href="https://www.thefirehoseproject.com">theFirehoseProject</a>.
                    I'm always trying to learn different technologies whether it's
                    the new hottest framework or something older but well
                    established with a strongly backed developer community.</p>
                    <p>When I'm not reading through software documentation or building
                    out side projects, I play, write and record with my band. I'm
                    also practicing my craft at brewing coffee and making bad
                    latte art as someday I'd like to open a small cafe so I can
                    name drinks after old metal bands.</p>
